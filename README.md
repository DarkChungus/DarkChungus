## **About Me**

- 🔭 I am currently a student in Nepal, doing mostly math-related programming.
- 🏅 Number 30 on ProjectEuler leaderboards of Nepal.
- ☁ I have a huge interest in problem-solving and beautiful algorithms. I try to develop my own algorithms from time to time.
- 🔢 I love math(especially proofs), I taught myself many topics such as Calculus 1 and 2, Trigonometry, etc. Whenever I see something new, I always try and find my own method of finding out WHY it is that formula, instead of just accepting it as it is.
- 🐱‍👤 I don't just code though, I also know how to edit videos, photos, and can do much more with my abilities!
